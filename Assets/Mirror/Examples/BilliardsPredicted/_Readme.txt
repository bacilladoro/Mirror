Advanced multiplayer Billiards demo with Prediction.

Please read this first:
https://mirror-networking.gitbook.io/docs/manual/general/client-side-prediction

Mouse drag the white ball to apply force.
PredictedRigidbody syncInterval is intentionally set pretty high so we can see when it corrects.

If you are a beginner, start with the basic Billiards demo instead.
If you are advanced, this demo shows how to use Mirror's prediction features for physics / FPS games.

Billiards is a great example to try our Prediction algorithm, it works extremely well here!

The only part we don't love yet is this:
- each ball has a PredictedRigidbody component and Rigidbody+Collider
- while predicting, PredictedRigibody sometimes moves the Rigidbody+Collider onto a temporary ghost object
- this works well, the only downside is that OnTriggerEnter etc. won't work on the main object while there's no collider.
=> we are looking to make this part easier in the future

Notes:
- Red/White ball Rigidbody CollisionMode needs to be ContinousDynamic to avoid white flying through red sometimes.
  even 'Continous' is not enough, we need ContinousDynamic.
